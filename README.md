# üöÄ Todo App with Redux Toolkit and JWT Authentication

This is a **full-stack Todo App** built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **JSON Server**, and **JWT Authentication**. It demonstrates how to implement authentication and manage a Todo List using **Redux Toolkit** for state management and **JSON Server** as a mock backend.

## üìù Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Secure registration and login system with JWT token-based authentication.
- **JWT Authentication**: Users must authenticate to access the Todo List. The token is stored in `localStorage`.
- **Todo CRUD Operations**: Users can **Add**, **Toggle (Complete/Incomplete)**, **Delete**, and **Clear** their tasks.
- **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users can access the Todo List page.
- **Responsive UI**: The app uses **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek and modern user interface.
